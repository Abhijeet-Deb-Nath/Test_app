|--------|------|-------------|
| `id` | bigint | Primary key |
| `user_id` | bigint | Comment author (FK to users) |
| `commentable_id` | bigint | Polymorphic ID (memory or reflection) |
| `commentable_type` | string | Model type (MemoryTreasure or MemoryReflection) |
| `comment_text` | text | Comment content (max 1000 chars) |
| `created_at` | timestamp | Creation time |
| `updated_at` | timestamp | Last update time |

**Relationships:**
- Polymorphic `commentable` → MemoryTreasure or MemoryReflection
- BelongsTo `author` → User

### 5. **Page Layout** (Redesigned)

**New Order:**
1. **Memory Card** (heading, title, description, media, delete option)
2. **Story Comments Section** 💬
   - Messenger-style thread
   - Quick comment input
3. **Nostalgic Reflections** 💭
